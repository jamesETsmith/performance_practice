Solutions taken straight from or modified from user archit91, see [the solutions post](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/solutions/1595195/c-python-7-simple-solutions-w-explanation-brute-force-dp-kadane-divide-conquer/?orderBy=most_votes). I mostly wanted to investigate the question the user poses in solution V (Kadane's Algorithm):

> "PS: I have tried running Solution - IV and this solution multiple times and this solution, despite being O(1) shows higher memory usage(28.8 MB on average vs 28 MB used by solution - IV) by LC consistently. If anyone can figure out the reason behind this, I will be happy to hear it out :)"
